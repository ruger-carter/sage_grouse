# Creating the Sage-grouse Fire Database

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Database Diagram

This is a diagram of my data. Primary keys are italicized. Foreign keys are 
shown in bold. sg_fire_plots table contains the data for individual plots. The 
pellet_count_raw table includes data recorded during pellet count surveys. The 
dog_transect_raw table includes data recorded during pointing dog surveys. 

```{r image, fig.cap="Database Diagram", fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("database_design.png")
```

## Creating the database
This is the code I used to create the database. We'll start with loading the
`DBI` and `RSQLite` Packages.

```{r pkg, eval = TRUE}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
```

First, we're going to start by establishing a connection to a SQLite database. 

```{r connection, eval = TRUE}
sg_db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "../sg.db")
```

## Creating the sage-grouse fire plot data

This table includes all plot data that we sampled using pointing dogs and pellet
counts.

```{r sg_fire_plots_table, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dbExecute(sg_db, "CREATE TABLE sg_fire_plots (
          global_id,
          plot_id varchar(5) NOT NULL,
          state varchar(2) CHECK (state IN ('Idaho', 'Utah')),
          date,
          type char (1) CHECK (type IN ('B','R')),
          elevation char (4),
          fire_year char (4),
          surveyor,
          PRIMARY KEY (plot_id)
          );")
#bring in csv of plot data
sg_fire_plots <- read.csv("../Data/raw_data/sg_fire_plots.csv")
names(sg_fire_plots)

#Enter data from CSV into table
dbWriteTable(sg_db, "sg_fire_plots", sg_fire_plots, append = TRUE)

```

This is what the content of the table looks like:

```{r show-sg_fire_plots}
#check data
dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM sg_fire_plots LIMIT 10;")
```

## Pellet Count Data

This table includes all the pellet count data collected on the plots.
```{r pellet_count_raw_table, eval =FALSE, echo = TRUE}

#Create table for pellet count data
dbExecute(sg_db, "CREATE TABLE pellet_count_raw (
          obs_id PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
          global_id,
          pellet_type varchar (15),
          pellet_age varchar (8),
          pellet_dist varchar (5),
          dist_to_edge varchar (5),
          transect_dist varchar (5),
          hab_type varchar (20)
          );")

#Bring in pellets data
pellet_count_raw <- read.csv("../Data/raw_data/pellet_raw.csv")

dbWriteTable (sg_db, "pellet_count_raw", pellet_count_raw, append = TRUE)

```

This is what the the contents of the table looks like

```{r show-pellet_count_raw}
#check data
dbGetQuery (sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count_raw LIMIT 10;")
```

## Dog Plot Data
This is the code where I created the dog plot table and inserted the data into
the table.

```{r dog_transect_raw_table , eval =FALSE, echo = TRUE}

#Bring in dog data
dbExecute(sg_db, "CREATE TABLE dog_transect_raw (
          obs_id PRIMARY KEY,
          plot_id varchar (5),
          obs varchar (10),
          n varchar (2),
          dist varchar (5)
          );")

dog_raw <- read.csv("../Data/raw_data/dog_raw.csv")

dbWriteTable(sg_db, "dog_transect_raw", dog_raw, append = TRUE)

```

This is what the data looks like.

```{r show-dog_transect_raw}

#check data
dbGetQuery (sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect_raw LIMIT 10;")

```

## Combining pellet count data with plot data

Because I am using nested data entry methods using Survey123, the data comes to
me in two separate data sheets. One sheet contains the information about the 
plot, the other sheet is all the pellet count observations. It links the two 
through a "global_id". I need to combine the two sheets to where each pellet 
observation also has the plot information. I am combining those below. 

```{r pellet_count_table , eval =FALSE, echo = TRUE}

dbExecute(sg_db, "CREATE TABLE pellet_count (
  observation INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  global_id,
  plot_id varchar(5),
  type char(1),
  elevation char (4),
  fire_year char(4),
  pellet_type,
  pellet_age,
  pellet_dist,
  dist_to_edge,
  transect_dist,
  hab_type,
  FOREIGN KEY (global_id) REFERENCES sg_fire_plots(global_id)
  FOREIGN KEY (global_id) REFERENCES pellet_count_raw(global_id)
  );")

dbExecute(sg_db, "INSERT INTO pellet_count (
global_id, plot_id, type, elevation, fire_year,pellet_type, pellet_age, 
  pellet_dist,dist_to_edge, transect_dist, hab_type)
    SELECT
    sg_fire_plots.global_id,
    sg_fire_plots.plot_id,
    sg_fire_plots.type,
    sg_fire_plots.elevation,
    sg_fire_plots.fire_year,
    pellet_count_raw.pellet_type,
    pellet_count_raw.pellet_age,
    pellet_count_raw.pellet_dist,
    pellet_count_raw.dist_to_edge,
    pellet_count_raw.transect_dist,
    pellet_count_raw.hab_type
    FROM sg_fire_plots LEFT JOIN pellet_count_raw USING (global_id)
    WHERE sg_fire_plots.global_id = pellet_count_raw.global_id
    ;")

dbGetQuery (sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count LIMIT 10;")

```

This is what the final pellet count table looks like. 

```{r show-pellet_count}

#check data

dbGetQuery (sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count LIMIT 10;")

```

## Combining dog transect data with plot data.

The same steps need to be done with my pointing dog transect data.

```{r dog_transect_table , eval =FALSE, echo = TRUE}

dbExecute(sg_db, "CREATE TABLE dog_transect (
  observation INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  plot_id varchar(5),
  type,
  fire_year,
  elevation,
  obs,
  n,
  dist,
  FOREIGN KEY (plot_id) REFERENCES sg_fire_plots (plot_id)
  FOREIGN KEY (plot_id) REFERENCES dog_transect_raw (plot_id)
  );")

dbExecute(sg_db, "INSERT INTO dog_transect (
plot_id, type, fire_year, elevation, obs, n, dist)
    SELECT
    sg_fire_plots.plot_id,
    sg_fire_plots.type,
    sg_fire_plots.fire_year,
    sg_fire_plots.elevation,
    dog_transect_raw.obs,
    dog_transect_raw.n,
    dog_transect_raw.dist
    FROM sg_fire_plots RIGHT JOIN dog_transect_raw USING (plot_id)
    WHERE sg_fire_plots.plot_id = dog_transect_raw.plot_id
    ;")

```

This is what the final data sheet looks like. 

```{r show-dog_transect}

#check data
dbGetQuery (sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect LIMIT 10;")

```

# Data Wrangling and Visualization of Dog Transects

In this chapter, I am going to wrangle and visualize my dog transect data. First
I need to load the tidyverse, patchwork, and viridis packages for data wrangling and 
visualization.

```{r load_packages, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
```

Reminder of the tables we made in chapter 1.
```{r show-tables, echo = FALSE}
#check data
dbListTables(sg_db)

```

## Dog Transect Detections

I am going to start by plotting out the number of sage-grouse, chukar, and gray 
partridge we detected in burned and reference plots.

```{r show-dog_transect_plot,out.width = "100%"}
dog_transects <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect;")

dog_transects %>%
  mutate(obs = factor(obs, levels = c("Sage-Grouse Chicks",
                                      "Adult Female Sage-Grouse",
                                      "Adult Male Sage-grouse",
                                      "Gray Partridge",
                                      "Chukar"))) %>% 
  group_by(obs, type) %>% 
  mutate(n = as.numeric(n)) %>% 
  summarize(nsum = sum(n)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type, geom_text(3.00))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=nsum, fill = type), stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~obs, nrow = 1) +
  labs(x = "", y = "# of Detections", fill = "Plot Type")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    size = 7))+
  ggtitle("Number of detections in burned and reference plots") 
  

```

## Detection Distance

This is a plot of distance of the detection from the transect line.

```{r show-dog_transect_dist,out.width = "100%"}
dog_transects <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect;")

dog_transects %>%
  mutate(dist = as.numeric(dist)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dist)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Distance of Detection from Transect") +
  labs(x = "Detection Distance (m)")


```
It looks like our detections peak around 20 m and fall from there.

## Detections by Fire Year

Let's look at detections in burned plots by year burned.

```{r show-dog_transect_year_burned,out.width = "100%"}
dog_transects <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect;")

dog_transects %>%
  mutate(obs = factor(obs, levels = c("Sage-Grouse Chicks",
                                      "Adult Female Sage-Grouse",
                                      "Adult Male Sage-grouse",
                                      "Gray Partridge",
                                      "Chukar"))) %>% 
  group_by(obs, fire_year) %>% 
  mutate(n = as.numeric(n)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(fire_year)) %>%
  summarize(nsum = sum(n)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fire_year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=nsum, fill = obs), stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~obs, nrow = 1) +
  labs(x = "Fire Year", y = "# of Detections", fill = "")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    size = 7))+
  ggtitle("Number of detections in burned and reference plots") +
   theme(legend.key.size = unit(.4, 'cm'))
  

```
No clear pattern is emerging. 

## Detections of sage-grouse by elevation

Let's visualize sage-grouse detections by elevation.
```{r show-dog_transect_elevation,out.width = "100%"}
dog_transects <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM dog_transect;")

dog_transects %>%
  mutate(obs = factor(obs, levels = c("Sage-Grouse Chicks",
                                      "Adult Female Sage-Grouse",
                                      "Adult Male Sage-grouse"))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(obs)) %>% 
  mutate(n = as.numeric(n)) %>%
  mutate(elevation = as.numeric(elevation)) %>% 
  mutate(elevation = (elevation/3.281)) %>% 
  group_by(type, elevation) %>% 
  summarize(nsum = sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=nsum, fill = type), stat = "identity" ) +
  facet_wrap(~type)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Sage-grouse Detections by Elevation") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (m)", y = "# of detections", fill = "Plot Type")


```
No clear pattern is emerging. 

# Data Wrangling and Visualization of Pellet Transects 

This chapter looks at wrangling and visualizing all of the pellet transect data.

## Pellets detected by plot type

Let's look at the number of pellets detected in burned and reference plots.

```{r show-pellet_transect_plot,out.width = "100%"}
pellet_count <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count;")

pellet_count %>%
  group_by(type) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=n, fill = type), stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "", y = "# of Detections", fill = "Plot Type")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Number of pellet detections in burned and reference plots") 
  

```

It looks like we detected more sage-grouse pellets in reference plots when compared to burned plots.

## Pellets Detected by Habitat Type

Let's look at what habitat type pellets were detected within burned and reference plots.

```{r show-pellet_transect_habitat,out.width = "100%"}
pellet_count <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count;")

pellet_count %>%
  group_by(hab_type,type) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(!all(hab_type == "")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=n, fill = type), stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~hab_type)+
  labs(x = "Plot Type", y = "# of Detections", fill = "Plot Type")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Number of pellet detected by habitat type") 
  

```
It looks like most of the pellets were detected in low and black sage-brush. This could be 
because it's easier to detect pellets within these habitat types, or because sage-grouse use
these areas more.

## Pellet Age
Let's look at pellet age in burned and unburned plots

```{r show-pellet_transect_age,out.width = "100%"}
pellet_count <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count;")

pellet_count %>%
  group_by(pellet_age,type) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(!all(pellet_age == "")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=n, fill = type), stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~pellet_age)+
  labs(x = "Plot Type", y = "# of Detections", fill = "Pellet Age")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Age of Pellets") 
  

```
It looks like the age of the pellets stays similar across burned and reference plots, with old and very old pellets 
being detected the most.

## Pellet Distance

Let's plot out pellet distance from transect line to look at approximately how far pellets are being detected.

```{r show-pellet_transect_dist,out.width = "100%"}
pellet_count <- dbGetQuery(sg_db, "SELECT * FROM pellet_count;")

pellet_count %>%
  filter(!all(pellet_dist == "")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(pellet_dist)) %>% 
  mutate(pellet_dist = as.numeric(pellet_dist)) %>% 
  mutate(pellet_dist = pellet_dist*2.4) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pellet_dist)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Distance of Pellet Detected") +
  labs(x = "Detection Distance (cm)")

```

Looks like most of our pellets are detected at distances less than 3 meters.
