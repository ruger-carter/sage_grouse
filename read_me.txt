Northwestern Utah/ South Central Idaho Sage-grouse project.

For my final project, I would like to work on data cleaning of my Greater Sage-grouse pellet count and pointing dog data. 
I have two data sets that will be used in one manuscript. The two data sets are sage-grouse pellet counts, and pointing
dog transects where numbers of grouse are counted. I am adding both to one project, with a data folder, code folder,
outputs folder, and the manuscript folder. 

added .gitignore file that ignores my ouputs folder and my user specific r files.
